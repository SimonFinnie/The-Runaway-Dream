The Runaway Dream is a side scrolling arcade shoot ‘em up. The player chooses from a selection of
unique ships and weapons, which are unlocked as you progress the game. The objective of the game is to progress through the 5 levels and destroying as many ships as possible to try and beat the high score. This game is made to start reasonably difficult and increase from there.
