# The-Runaway-Dream
This is a classic 2D side scrolling shoot em up game based designed as part of a course in computer science. It is a project for unity and all code is written in c#. This project was completed in 4 weeks from the planning stages til the final copy was produced.
The game explains how to play.
To install you will need a working copy of unity installed to which you will need to build this game.
This game was designed to be played in a 4:3 aspect ratio, and so if a greater aspect ratio is selected, the screen will be stretched and some behaviour will be slightly changed.
This project in its current state is being left as is as I move onto other ventures, so anyone who is interested can do what they want with it.
This game is a lot of difficult fun, with a tough but fair difficulty curve. A good way to kill a couple of hours.
